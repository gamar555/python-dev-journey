# 📅 Day 3 - Real-World Python Conditionals & Logic 💻

This folder includes Python programs that simulate real-life use cases using `if`, `elif`, `else`, and logical operators. These examples are inspired by how actual tech companies build features like login systems, access control, and checkout logic.

---

## 🔍 Topics Covered
- ✅ `if`, `elif`, `else` statements
- ✅ Boolean logic: `and`, `or`, `not`
- ✅ Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>=`
- ✅ User input and real-time condition checks
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Grading systems

## 🧪 Files & Features

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `login_system.py` | Simulates a login form with username & password |
| `checkout.py` | Simulates a Zomato-style cart with delivery and coupon logic |
| `employee_access.py` | Controls access based on user role (admin, QA, HR) |
| `evaluate_grade.py` | Converts numeric score into letter grades (A to F) |

---

## 🚀 How to Run

Run any script like this:

```bash
python3 login_system.py



##🎯 Real-Time Use Cases
#These examples match real-life scenarios:

Login systems → Admin dashboards

Checkout logic → E-commerce apps (Zomato, Flipkart)

Access control → Internal tools in tech companies
